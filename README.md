Semiconductor metrology, the science of measurement, plays an indispensable role in the fabrication of integrated circuits (ICs). It ensures that semiconductor devices adhere to the stringent standards necessary for optimal performance.

Metrology is vital throughout the semiconductor manufacturing process, from substrate preparation to the final inspection of chips. It maintains process control by monitoring and controlling the myriad parameters that influence manufacturing, ensuring the production of reliable, high-quality semiconductor devices.

During the semiconductor manufacturing process, it's impractical to measure every die due to time and cost constraints. Yet, for creating predictive models that forecast yield and enable virtual metrology, comprehensive measurement data across all dies is crucial. This is where the concept of Kriging plays a pivotal role.

Kriging, a sophisticated statistical method, enables the prediction of unmeasured points based on the spatial correlation of measured data. In the context of semiconductor metrology, Kriging is used to fill in the gaps where direct measurements are lacking, allowing for the construction of detailed maps of wafer characteristics without physically measuring every die. This approach significantly enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of the manufacturing process by enabling predictive models that can forecast yields and identify potential issues before they escalate, thereby saving time and reducing costs while maintaining quality control.
